    <h2>What is MediguideAI?</h2>
    <p>
        MediguideAI is an intelligent healthcare guidance web application designed
        to provide structured medical awareness and basic decision support to users.
        It helps people understand symptoms, identify health risks, and take safe
        actions using rule-based logic and AI-assisted interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project is developed as an educational and practical implementation
        of modern web technologies and AI in healthcare support systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Why MediguideAI?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Early symptom understanding</li>
        <li>Prevention-focused guidance</li>
        <li>Emergency awareness</li>
        <li>Reliable and safe health information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use MediguideAI</h2>

    <p><strong>Use when:</strong> You want early understanding of common symptoms.</p>

    <h3>2. AI Health Chat</h3>

        with general medical awareness, precautions, and safe information.

    <h3>3. Do & Don’t Generator</h3>
